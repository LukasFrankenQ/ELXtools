#### Do batteries contribute to the problems they rectify in the BM?

* Batteries are an important contributor to balancing actions in the UK power systems.
* However, it stands to reason that some of the grid constraint they alleviate are exacerbated through their own activity on the wholesale market.
* This note investigates, and finds some supporting evidence to this hypothesis.
* We show three things:
    1. In northern Scotland (north of the central belt; probably north of B4), we statistically prove that for a subset of batteries:
        - between March 25 and July 17, whenever _any_ of the included batteries has accepted bids, the summed export of the same batteries is positively correlated with their summed accepted bid volumes. 
    2. South of the B4 boundary, we statistically prove that for a subset of batteries:
        - between March 25 and July 17, whenever _any_ of the included batteries has accepted offers, the summed import of the same batteries is positively correlated with their summed accepted offer volumes. 
    3. The opposite correlation, bid vs export volumes south of B4 and vice versa, are less pronounced.
* To show this, we use Elexon's data on Physical Notification (PN) and Bid-Offer Acceptance (BOA) for four random batteries north of B4, and four random batteries south of B4.
* This data is compiled to a timeseries for the timespan between March 25th 2024 and July 17th 2024 into a PN and BOA activity in a temporal resolution of one minute.
